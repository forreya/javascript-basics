# JavaScript Basics

This repository was used to learn JavaScript through a series of exercises that built on previous knowledge or introduced new concepts.

## Learning Objectives

From these exercises & challenges, I achieved the following learning objectives:

- Tested simple JavaScript programs using Node.
- Explained how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking programming.
- Worked through challenges designed to help me learn how to use JavaScript in a real application, including unit tests, multiple classes, and external dependencies on packages and remote APIs.

## Challenges Completed

Here are the programs that are part of this repository:

1. A Search Function
2. A Shopping Basket
3. A Thermostat
4. A Pok√©dex
5. A Weather Client
6. A Web Server
